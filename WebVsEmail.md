In Web vs. Email

            Boxes can have overflow

            Images can float around text

            Background Images

           

 

Email Considerations:

Microsoft Outlook is Buggy:

- We have a testing suite that lets us get rid of most bugs. But it is not going to catch 100% of the bugs out there.
    - Here's what a sample 

Text over images

-       We can make the whole thing an image

-       We can put it over the image, but Outlook gets rid of the image and makes it a solid color

No box/text shadows

Manually forcing text to wrap

-       It puts individual words on their own lines on a phone

Vertical line delineating separation of 2 columns

-       On a phone vertical lines look strange when they are left hanging

 

General Rule of Thumb:

            More columns more problems
